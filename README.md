# Pokémon Black and White 2 - GBA Demake
Welcome to pokeblack2! pokeblack2 is a GBA demake and reimagining of Pokémon Black 2 and Pokémon White 2. It has various tweaks and tons of extra features, mechanics, moves, Pokémon, abilities, items, and so much more not present in Vanilla Emerald or in Gen 5. pokeblack2 is built upon the incredible work of the [rh-hideout](https://github.com/rh-hideout) team, and their work on the [pokeemerald-expansion](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion).

## What Features Are/Will Be Present?
The following features are planned to be added in a future release, or have already been added in a past release. For more details and a more extensive list, check the project's [open issues](https://github.com/Pokemon-Demake-Team/pokeblack2/issues) and changelogs.
 - **A complete UI overhaul.** The UI will be overhauled and updated to either match Gen 5 or fit its style and aesthetic. Since Pokémon Black and White 2 are DS titles, some things will need to be tweaked to make it fit the single-screen GBA layout. We are recreating this layout based on cross-comparison and looks alone, not porting it, so it won't match the Black 2/White 2 UI exactly. Additionally, some UI menus or elements may be completely reimagined or completely redone.
 - **Modern Battle Mechanics powered by the pokeemerald-expansion.** The pokeemerald-expansion has features from all modern generations implemented, so all of the battle mechanics will be tweaked to match modern games as closely as possible.
 - **A complete recreation and reimagination of the Unovan overworld.** Our goal is to reimagine the overworld, recreating the tilesets, assets, maps, NPCs, battles, music, and more to more closely match our vision of a reimagined Unova. This is by far the largest and most daunting task, so it will likely take the longest to get to a place in which we are comfortable calling it completed.
 - **A completely updated Pokédex.** Thanks to the pokeemerald-expansion, we are able to include Pokémon all the way up to Gen 9. Tons of options are available all throughout the game, so do try and catch them all!
 - **Generation 5 exclusive features.** The Gen 5 games introduced many features and mechanics that were never seen before or again, like seasons, the PWT, the key system, etc. We have tried our best to recreate some these features, although they may not be fully accurate or perfect.
 - **An increase in difficulty.** Difficulty hacks are a staple in modern ROM Hacking. As in B2W2, three different difficulties will be available: Easy (Meant for the casual player to have a fun playthrough experience. Opposing trainers have lower-level Pokémon and less competetive teams.), Normal (The standard experience. Level caps are implemented and boss trainers have hand-picked, competetive teams.), and Hard (The ultimate nuzlocking experience. Every trainer has carefully picked Pokémon, abilities, moves, items, etc. and strategy and planning is required on the player's part to ensure victory in every battle.) 
 - **Fully open-source and always free.** This is a project made by and for the ROM Hacking community. As per our and the ROM Hacking Hideout's policies, no project using our work as a base or any of its assets may require or request money in any way, including donations, unless specifically given permission by the ROM Hacking Hideout and the Pokémon Demake Team. If you find an issue or have a feature you want us to tweak, you may [report it](https://github.com/Pokemon-Demake-Team/pokeblack2/issues) and we will attempt to fix it as soon as time allows. Please remember we are a small team doing this in our free time, so it may take a little bit for us to get to your issue or request.

## What Is the Status of the Project?
Currently, pokeblack2 is `0%` completed. This will be updated periodically as the project is worked on. **An exact release/completion date will NEVER be provided,** as we are not a game studio and have limited available time and resources.

## Credits
